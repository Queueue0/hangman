# hangman

A simple command line hangman game I made to learn the basics of Go

## Installation

Make sure you have go installed, then run
`go install github.com/Queueue0/hangman@latest`

## Info

Supports playing solo as both the guesser and the executioner, or local multiplayer with one player typing in the word and the other player guessing. When playing as the executioner, the program will play according to [Jan Misali's conjectured perfect hangman strategy](https://youtu.be/le5uGqHKll8?t=192).
